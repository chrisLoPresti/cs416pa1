Notes from recitation on the assignment

***split by: spaces, tabs, new lines

***convert all words to lowercase 

example:
./mapred [-wordcount,-sort] [-procs, -threads] -4 -4 [-infile] [-outfile]

input file: this is a sample sentence to illustrate a simple point to you.

mission: read all of the words. mapper will split them up to different procs or threads

Now we see that there are 12 words in the sentence, split them by space or return character etc.

create key pairs as vectors:
map 1 => (this, 1) (is, 1) (a,1) 
map 2=> (simple, 1) (sentence, 1) (to, 1)
map 3=> (illustrate, 1) (a, 1) (simple, 1)
map 4=> (point, 1) (to, 1) (you, 1)

before we go to the reducer, shuffle! (sort all the words)

(a,1) (is, 1) (this, 1)
(sentence, 1) (simple, 1) (to, 1)
(a, 1) (illustrate, 1) (simple, 1)
(point, 1) (to, 1) (you, 1)

shuffle phase sorts =>

(a,1) (a,1) (illustrate, 1) (is, 1) (point, 1) (sentence, 1) (simple, 1) (simple, 1) (this, 1) (to, 1) (to, 1) (you, 1)

now reducer takes 3 words per and combines like terms=>

(a,2) (illustrate, 1)
(is, 1) (point, 1) (sentence, 1)
(simple, 2) (this, 1)
(to, 2) (you, 1)

do one last final combine phase to combine anything across reducer outputes
